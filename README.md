Simple C++ ATM simulation that lets a user:
- Check balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Exit

  The program uses function prototypes, pass-by-value (for balance inquiry), pass-by-reference (for deposit and withdrawal), and basic input validation to prevent negative deposits/withdrawals and overdrafts.
